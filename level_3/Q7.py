7. Write a program to construct a dictionary from the two lists
    containing the names of students and their corresponding
    subjects. The dictionary should map the students with their
    respective subjects. Letâ€™s see how to do this using for loops and
    dictionary comprehension.
        Input: [Sam, Alice, Mona] ,
               [Commerce, Science, Computer]

        Output: [Sam: Commerce, Alice: Science , Mona: Computer]
